### Welcome to the FEWsLab Website

At **FEWsLab**, we investigate the form and function of interconnections across **food**, **energy**, and **water** systems.

Our lab combines **Network modeling**, **Socio-technical data**, **Ethical and policy analyses**.

We aim to foster a more **sustainable** and **secure** environment, balancing **fundamental research** with **practical policy outcomes**.
